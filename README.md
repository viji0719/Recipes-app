Recipe Explorer is a full-stack web application for browsing and searching a curated collection of 8,451 US recipes sourced from Allrecipes.com.
The backend is built with Python FastAPI and uses SQLite as the database, managed through SQLAlchemy. On first run, it automatically parses a JSON dataset, handles invalid values like NaN by storing them as NULL, and imports all recipes into the database. It exposes two REST API endpoints — one for paginated listing sorted by rating, and another for filtered search supporting partial text match on title and cuisine, plus comparison operators (>=, <=, <, >) on numeric fields like rating, total time, and calories.
The frontend is built with React and Vite, featuring a visually distinctive magazine-style tile layout. Recipes are displayed as cards in a masonry column grid, each showing a dynamically sourced food image, cuisine badge, star rating, and key metadata like cook time and calories. Clicking any card opens a slide-in detail drawer with the full recipe description, expandable time breakdown, serving size, and a complete nutrition facts table.
Users can filter recipes directly from the interface using a filter bar that debounces input — meaning API calls only trigger after the user pauses typing, keeping the experience smooth. Pagination is fully customizable, allowing between 15 and 50 results per page. The UI handles all edge cases gracefully with loading skeletons while data fetches, a friendly empty state when no results match, and a clear error screen if the backend is unreachable.
The design follows a warm editorial aesthetic — cream and terracotta tones, Cormorant Garamond serif display font paired with Jost for body text, and fluid hover animations throughout. All styling is done with inline React styles using hardcoded color values for reliable cross-browser rendering.
The project is structured to be straightforward to run locally — the backend starts with a single uvicorn command and the frontend with npm run dev, with Vite's proxy eliminating any CORS configuration.
